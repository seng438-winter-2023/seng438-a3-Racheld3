Assignment 3- Whitebox Testing Test Plan

Introduction:
This test plan will focus on creating/designing new unit tests for org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range. 
The objective of creating these new unit tests is to increase their code coverage.

1 TEST STRATEGY
1.1 Scope of Testing
1.1.1 Feature to be tested
From org.jfree.data.DataUtilities the following methods will be tested:
- equals 
- clone
- calculateColumnTotal 
- calculateRowTotal
- createNumberArray
- getCumulativePercentages

From org.jfree.data.Range the following methods will be tested:
- getLowerBound
- getUpperBound
- getLength
- getCentralValue
- contains
- intersects
- constrain
- combine
- combineIgnoringNaN
- expandToInclude
- expand
- shift
- scale
- equals
- hashCode
- toString

1.2 Test Type
White-Box testing will be used for JFreeChart.

1.3 Risk and Issues
Risk:                                                
Team member lack the required skills for parts of assignment.
Mitigation:
Other team members can help that person pick up those skills.

1.4 Test Logistics
1.4.1 Who will test?
For this assignment we will split into pairs of 2. One pair will test data.DataUtilities and the other data.Range.
Then upon completion of the tests, review each other’s’ tests, looking for any inconsistencies or defects in the
tests themselves.
